<p>my story</p>
<p>As a ninth-grade student at Pasig Community School Foundation Incorporated, I'm on a journey to explore and capture the world through different lenses - both literally and figuratively. My passion for photography allows me to tell stories through images, freezing moments in time that might otherwise go unnoticed in our fast-paced world.
